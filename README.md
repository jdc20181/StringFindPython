Basic Exercises on the `String.find()` Python method. 

#What is `String.find()` ?

`String.Find()` is a function to find something [In a certain position] in a string of text. Each character - including space is turned into a number. 

Example:

`"Alan Turing".find("N", 4)`

The "N" is what we are looking for, and the "4" is where we start. 

Alan Turing

012345678910

Start at `0` and count. 

So the answer would be:

`9`

Additonally, 

The Numerical number is option for example:

`"Ada Lovelace".find(" ")`

This is asking to find the first Space. 

Again - Start at `0`

Ada Lovelace
0123

So - The answer to this would be:

`3`
